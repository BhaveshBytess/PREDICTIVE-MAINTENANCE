# 🎯 PREDICTIVE MAINTENANCE - DEMO GUIDE
> **Private Demo Manual** - For presentation and demonstration purposes

---

## 📋 PRE-DEMO CHECKLIST

### Option A: Cloud Demo (Recommended)
- [ ] Browser open to [`https://predictive-maintenance-ten.vercel.app/`](https://predictive-maintenance-ten.vercel.app/)
- [ ] Backend is warm — visit [`/ping`](https://predictive-maintenance-uhlb.onrender.com/ping) and confirm `{"status": "ok"}`
- [ ] This guide open on phone/second monitor

> ⚠️ **Render Free Tier:** The backend sleeps after ~15 min of inactivity. The frontend sends a 10-min keep-alive ping automatically, but if the backend is cold, hit `/ping` manually and wait ~30s for it to wake up.

### Option B: Local Demo
- [ ] Docker Desktop closed (we use local development)
- [ ] 3 PowerShell terminals ready
- [ ] Browser open to `http://localhost:3000`
- [ ] This guide open on phone/second monitor

cd "c:\Users\oumme\OneDrive\Desktop\Predictive Maintenance"
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

### Open Browser
**URL (Cloud):** `https://predictive-maintenance-ten.vercel.app/`
**URL (Local):** `http://localhost:3000`

## 🧪 STEP 2: BUILD BASELINE (Do This First!)

### Generate Healthy Data (20 seconds of normal readings)
```powershell
python scripts/generate_data.py --asset_id Motor-01 --duration 20 --healthy
```

### Build Baseline Model
```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/baseline/build?asset_id=Motor-01" -Method Post
```
✅ **Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "baseline_id": "...",
  "sample_count": 20
}
```

### Check Current Status
```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/status/Motor-01"
```

---

## 📊 STEP 3: DEMONSTRATE ALL RISK LEVELS

### 🟢 LOW RISK (Healthy State)
**Show first!** After building baseline, dashboard shows:
- Health Score: **75-100** (green ring)
- Risk Level: **LOW** (green badge)
- Maintenance Window: **~60 days**
- **Baseline targets** displayed on each status card (e.g., "Target: 230.0 V")
- **NO red dashed lines** on chart

---

### 🟡 MODERATE RISK (Slight Anomaly)
```powershell
$body = @{
    asset_id='Motor-01'
    voltage_v=240
    current_a=17
    power_factor=0.85
    vibration_g=0.25
} | ConvertTo-Json
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri 'http://localhost:8000/api/v1/data/simple' -Method Post -Body $body -ContentType 'application/json'
```

**What to point out:**
- Health Score: **50-74** (yellow/orange ring)
- Risk Level: **MODERATE** (orange badge)
- Maintenance Window: **~19 days**
- **Red dashed lines with ⚠️** appear at anomaly point!

---

### 🟠 HIGH RISK (Significant Anomaly)
```powershell
$body = @{
    asset_id='Motor-01'
    voltage_v=250
    current_a=19
    power_factor=0.75
    vibration_g=0.4
} | ConvertTo-Json
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri 'http://localhost:8000/api/v1/data/simple' -Method Post -Body $body -ContentType 'application/json'
```

**What to point out:**
- Health Score: **25-49** (orange ring)
- Risk Level: **HIGH** (orange badge)
- Maintenance Window: **~4 days**
- Multiple explanations in Insight panel

---

### 🔴 CRITICAL RISK (Extreme Anomaly)
```powershell
$body = @{
    asset_id='Motor-01'
    voltage_v=280
    current_a=25
    power_factor=0.60
    vibration_g=2.5
} | ConvertTo-Json
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri 'http://localhost:8000/api/v1/data/simple' -Method Post -Body $body -ContentType 'application/json'
```

**What to point out:**
- Health Score: **0-24** (red ring)
- Risk Level: **CRITICAL** (red badge)
- Maintenance Window: **< 1 day**
- Vibration spiked **2500%** above normal!
- Clear explanation: "Vibration value (2.5) exceeds observed maximum (0.22)"

---

## 🔄 STEP 4: DEMONSTRATE RECOVERY

> **Important:** The Degradation Index (DI) is **monotonic** — it never decreases by itself. Sending healthy data **stops further damage** but does NOT restore health. The only way to fully recover health is to **Purge & Re-Calibrate**.

### Option A: Send Healthy Data (Stops Degradation)
```powershell
python scripts/generate_data.py --asset_id Motor-01 --duration 10 --healthy
```

**What to point out:**
- DI **stops increasing** (damage rate drops to 0)
- Health Score **stabilizes** at its current value (does NOT recover)
- This demonstrates that healthy operation prevents further damage
- To recover health, you must purge (see Option B)

### Option B: Purge & Re-Calibrate (Full Reset — Only Way to Recover)
Click the purple **"🗑️ Purge & Re-Calibrate"** button in the System Control Panel.

> This writes DI=0.0 to InfluxDB, clears in-memory baselines/detectors/DI state, and resets the system to IDLE. Health returns to 100%. A confirmation dialog prevents accidental clicks.

**What to point out:**
- Health Score returns to **100%** (DI reset to 0.0)
- System state returns to IDLE
- All historical data is cleared
- You can re-run calibration from scratch (Step 2)
- This is the **only way** to recover health after degradation
- Useful when stale data corrupts baselines during demos

## 📄 STEP 5: DOWNLOAD INDUSTRIAL REPORT

### Click the "DOWNLOAD FULL REPORT" Button
The dashboard has a blue button: **"📄 DOWNLOAD FULL REPORT (5-Page PDF)"**

**What to show in the PDF:**
1. **Page 1 - Executive Summary**: Large health gauge, RUL days, risk level badge
2. **Page 2 - Sensor Analysis**: Current readings vs baseline, 24h statistics
3. **Page 3 - ML Explainability**: Bar chart showing which sensors contributed most to the risk
4. **Page 4 - Business ROI**: $450 maintenance vs $45,000 failure = 100x ROI, recommended actions
5. **Page 5 - Audit Trail**: Millisecond-precision process log, ISO compliance checkboxes

### Alternative Downloads
- **Excel button**: Spreadsheet format with Summary (includes DI, Damage Rate, RUL), Operator Logs, and Raw Sensor Data sheets
- **Basic PDF button**: 1-page executive summary with Health Grade, KPIs, and Cumulative Prognostics (DI, Damage Rate, RUL)

## 🎤 TALKING POINTS

### When Asked "What Problem Does This Solve?"
> "Unexpected equipment failures cost industries millions. This system monitors industrial motors in real-time and predicts maintenance needs BEFORE failures occur, reducing downtime by up to 40%."

### When Asked "How Does the ML Work?"
> "We use an Isolation Forest algorithm trained on healthy sensor data. When readings deviate from baseline, the system accumulates a Degradation Index — a monotonic damage score that never decreases. A critical fault drives health from 100% to 0% in about 4-5 minutes. The system also estimates Remaining Useful Life (RUL) based on the current damage rate."

### When Asked "What Makes This Different?"
> "Unlike black-box ML systems, we provide EXPLAINABILITY. The system tells you exactly WHY it flagged an issue - 'Vibration is 3x above normal' - so operators can take targeted action."

### When Asked "What About Compliance?"
> "Our 5-page Industrial Report includes an audit trail with millisecond precision and ISO 55000/13374 compliance verification. It's designed to meet industrial audit requirements."

### When Asked "What Sensors Are Monitored?"
> "We track 4 key signals: Voltage (V), Current (A), Power Factor, and Vibration (g). These are the primary indicators of motor health."
